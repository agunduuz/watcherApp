# Enhanced Watcher App 🎬

In this project, I made use of the API provided by https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs, which offers free access to a wide range of film projects. 
I utilized the Fetch API method in this project, but you can also use the XML method 🙂 
By leveraging dynamic page content, I had the opportunity to display the data I obtained within the page. <br>
The slider view at the top of the homepage was implemented using a third-party software called https://swiperjs.com/swiper-api, resulting in an elegant and visually appealing animation. 
For film/TV show searches, I employed a separate API function as it required a more complex Fetch method. 
Through this project, I learned and experienced many things that I was not familiar with before ⭐ 
Of course, what I've described here is just the tip of the iceberg 🏔
